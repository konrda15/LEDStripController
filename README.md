# LEDStripController


LEDStripController is a program I wrote to control a LED strip with an ordinary TV-Remote. It runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 which is connected to an infrared sensor and an individually addressable LED strip. Using the TV remote, I can choose between a large number of different settings which can be combined to produce almost any pattern and animation of LEDs you can imagine.

This project is not quite finished yet. In the future I plan on implementing a few more features as well as a more detailed documentation.
